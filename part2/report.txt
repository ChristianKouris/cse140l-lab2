The day of the week enhancement is a simple improvement from the previous alarm clock. Nothing too fancy was needed. In fact, the only new module that I added is the mod7 module which represents each day of the week as 0-6. Of course, there needed to be a new input in the struct_diag module in order to set the day of the week, and there needed to be an adjustment to the Buzz output. The alarm clock never buzzes on Saturday and Sunday which is 5 and 6 in the mod7.
